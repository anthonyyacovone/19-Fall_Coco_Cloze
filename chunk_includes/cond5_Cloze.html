Tully\'s heart was beating like a million pounding horses were stuck inside her.] \"Where in the world was Coco? Could he have climbed out of his glass cage?\" Tully thought.] She got down on the floor and crawled around, checking under the tables and the bookcases.] But all Tully saw were little white hairs, which stuck to the knees of her pants.] Hmmm, what could those be from? But first things first, why would someone steal Coco? Since Tully was an amazing detective, she knew that the tiny details are the key to solving a case.] If Coco was stolen, then the library was definitely a crime scene.] Tully quickly pulled out her notebook out of her backpack.] She was in charge of writing down all of the notes for the Gumshoe gang, which was usually stuff like suspects, dues, motives, and alibis.] She examined the scene.] She wrote down that both Howard and Coco\'s lids had been removed.] She walked all along the row of cages, looking for something out of place.] Aha! At the end of the table next to Zake\'s cage was a paper towel.] Sitting on top of the paper towel was a large hunk of cheddar cheese with a single bite taken out.] A bite so perfect, she could see all of the teeth marks.] Tully carefully lifted the hunk of cheese and placed it in her backpack.] She quickly finished giving food and water to Howard and Zake and glanced at the clock.] Alex would be in extended day right now, so Tully had 20 minutes to go see him and tell him about Coco!] To continue, please press \'ESC\'"
