The turtle\'s taking a nap?\" \"No! Like kidnapped! Coco\'s gone!\" Javier gasped.] \"That\'s terrible!\" \"I know,\" Tully said and then quickly explained what she\'d found.] \"We need to tell Mr Hornswoggle,\" Alex said, putting down his marker.] \"He won\'t be back at school until tomorrow.] I was hoping we could figure out something today,\" Tully said.] \"What if he climbed out of his cage?\" Alex asked.] Javier shook his head.] \"Turtles can\'t climb.] Especially aquatic turtles\".] Tully stared at Javier.] \"Hey, you know a bunch about animals, right?\" Javier shrugged.] \"Some.] I guess.] My parents own the pet shop Claws and Paws down at the Centerville mall\".] \"That\'s right! Then you can help us,\" Tully said as she whipped out her notebook.] \"What do you mean by aquatic turtle?\" \"Aquatic turtles need to be in water most of the time, that\'s why their feet are webbed.] Land turtles like to swim sometimes, but they spend a lot of time, well, on land\".] \"What kind of aquatic turtle is Coco?\" Tully asked.] Javier shrugged again.] \"I don\'t know.] Some kind of map turtle.] The pattern of white, black, and green lines and circles all over his carapace looks like a map, but there are lots of different kinds of map turtles.] And we don\'t have any as pretty as Coco at the pet store\".] Tully stopped him and wrinkled her nose.] \"Wait, what is a carapace?\" \"His shell,\" Javier explained.] \"Oh, why didn\'t you say that silly!\"] To continue, please press \'ESC\'"
