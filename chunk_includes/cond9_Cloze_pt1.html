That means shell!\" Tully interjected.] \"Very good,\" Mr Hornswoggle said.] \"Would someone want Coco because she\'s rare?\" Mr Hornswoggle nodded.] \"Possibly.] An adult Cagle\'s map turtle could easily sell for more than two hundred dollars, depending on the market.] Hatchlings could go for well over one hundred dollars each\".] \"Wow, that\'s a lot of cold, hard cash.] I could probably buy a whole pony with that kind of money,\" Tully said.] To continue, please press \'ESC\'"
