After school, Tully hugged all of her friends goodbye, slung her backpack over her shoulder, and made her way to the library.] Right away, she noticed Howard the hamster\'s lid was ajar.] Howard was running in his metal wheel.] He gave Tully a look, twitched his nose, and kept right on running.] Tully fixed his lid, then got the plastic container full of crickets to feed to Fluffy the tarantula.] And that\'s when Tully, the great detective, noticed the aquarium\'s lid was ajar too.] Interesting! Coco always spends his time swimming around his aquarium or laying on a rock under his UV sun lamp, which Mr Hornswoggle called \"basking\".] To continue, please press \'ESC\'"
