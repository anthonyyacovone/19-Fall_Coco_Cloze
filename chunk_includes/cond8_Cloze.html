Anyways, good luck with the turtle hunt\".] Megan turned and skipped off to play with her other friends.] And just like that, one suspect was down already, and Tully was no closer to solving the mystery of the turtle snatcher.] The next morning, Mr Hornswoggle came into the classroom just as they were moving over to the learning rug to play the Favorite Things game.] \"May I speak with Tully for a moment?\" Mr Hornswoggle asked Miss Flores.] Tully quickly whispered the situation in Miss Flores\' ear, and she gave the Gumshoe gang a hall pass.] \"Make it quick!\" They stepped out into the hall with Mr Hornswoggle.] Tully told him all about yesterday.] \"Oh, dear,\" he said.] \"This is very distressing\".] \"We\'re going to get Coco back,\" Tully said.] \"We are on the case, sir,\" Alex said.] Mr Hornswoggle pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and patted his forehead.] \"I very much hope so.] You see, Coco is gravid, and so we must make sure she returns to the nest in time\".] They all had no idea what he was talking about.] To continue, please press \'ESC\'"
