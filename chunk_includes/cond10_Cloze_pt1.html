Why?\" \"Just wondering,\" Tully said.] She wrote down a few notes in her notebook.] Suspect: Javier.] Motive: profit from sale of Coco and her adorable baby turtles.] Evidence: weird, nervous behavior, possibly because of guilty conscience.] \"Javier, could you tell us everything you did yesterday from before lunch until you left extended day?\" Tully asked very seriously.] Javier\'s face crumpled.] \"You think I took Coco?\" Tully felt a prick of sympathy.] But detectives must be tough to get the truth.] \"Javier, we need the facts\".] To continue, please press \'ESC\'"
