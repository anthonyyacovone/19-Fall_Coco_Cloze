Make sure to wear something elegant!\" Tully said and smiled at Emily.] It was finally the day of Tully\'s ninth birthday, and it was super fantastic.] She wore her silver and pink striped knee socks, a puffy orange skirt, a neon yellow shirt with a green glitter unicorn on it, and a pink feather boa wrapped around her neck.] All of her friends came, and guess what?
